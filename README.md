## 🧠 Waht I Learned

Building **Taskly** taught me to:

- **Creating and structuring an AI driven app from scratch📝**

---

- **Integrate AI** advice with AI Advisor API via Puter.js
- **Manage state** effectively with Nano Stores.
- **Route** seamlessly using Navigo.
- **Visualize data** via Chart.js (bar, doughnut, line, pie).
- **Polish UX** with Notyf toasts and a custom SVG timer.

## 🤌 What Was Intreste For Me:

For the fisrt time managing an AI assistant base on your own thoughts through code

```js
export const systemMsg = {
  role: "system",
  content: `
  your name is Taskly! you are a task advisor!
  `,
};

export const getAdvice = async () => {
  const reply = await puter.ai.chat(systemMsg, {
    model: "claude-3-7-sonnet",
  });

  return reply;
};
```
